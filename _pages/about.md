Hi, I'm Jiacheng Hou (侯佳成), a 2nd-year undergraduate student at [OSU CSE](https://cse.osu.edu/), advised by Prof. [Wei-lun Chao](https://sites.google.com/view/wei-lun-harry-chao/home).

My research interests lie in **3D computer vision**, **robust perception for autonomous driving**, **vision and language**, and **AI for science(biology + ecology)**. I am excited about developing robust 3D algorithms to find geometric structures from data.
