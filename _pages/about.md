# Jiacheng Hou

Contact: [hou.688@osu.edu](mailto:hou.688@osu.edu) · GitHub: [HJC704](https://github.com/HJC704)

Hi, I’m Jiacheng Hou (侯佳成), a 2nd-year undergraduate student at OSU CSE, advised by Prof. [Wei-lun Chao](https://sites.google.com/view/wei-lun-harry-chao/home).

<!-- I received my B.Eng. in Computer Science from **Shanghai Jiao Tong University (ACM class)**. From summer to winter 2024, I was a visiting student at **Cornell University**, where I was fortunately advised by **Prof. Kevin Ellis** on the **Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC)** problem. During my junior year, I did undergraduate research under **Prof. Wei-Long Zheng** in the BCMI laboratory, SJTU. -->

My research interests lie at machine learning, computer vision and their application to 3D foundation models, autonomous driving, generative modeling and multi-modal models.
