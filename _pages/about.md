# -- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

# Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

# Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

Hi, I’m Jiacheng Hou (侯佳成), a 2nd-year undergraduate student at OSU CSE, advised by Prof. [Wei-lun Chao](https://sites.google.com/view/wei-lun-harry-chao/home).

<!-- My research interests lies in **Large language model, Computer Vision, World model, and Program Synthesis**. I am excited about building more data-efficient and more generalizable agent. -->

My research interests lie at 3D computer vision, robust perception for autonomous driving, vision and language, and AI for science. I am exited about developing robust 3D algorithms to find geometric structures from data.

<!-- I received my B.Eng. in Computer Science from **Shanghai Jiao Tong University (ACM class)**. From summer to winter 2024, I was a visiting student at **Cornell University**, where I was fortunately advised by **Prof. Kevin Ellis** on the **Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC)** problem. During my junior year, I did undergraduate research under **Prof. Wei-Long Zheng** in the BCMI laboratory, SJTU. -->
